ABOUT
=====

Open BEAGLE is a versatile C++ evolutionary computation framework.
It provides a software environment to do any kind of EC, with a
fully-featured support for genetic programming and vector-based
evolutionary algorithms such genetic algorithms and evolution
strategies.

INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD THE DISTRIBUTION ON UNIX
==============================================

To build Open BEAGLE on Unix, uncompress the distribution, open a shell,
'cd' to the uncompressed distribution main directory, and type the
following commands.

      ./configure
      make clean
      make

This will configure and compile the libraries composing the framework.
Optionally, you can install the framework by typing the following command.

      make install

By default, the compiled libraries are installed in folder
'/usr/local/lib', while the headers are installed in folder
'/usr/local/include'. You can specify the installation folder by
giving the option '--prefix=PATH' to the 'configure' script.

'configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

'--prefix=PATH'
     Set the main installation folder (default: '/usr/local').

'--disable-shared'
     Disable the build of the shared framework libraries.

'--disable-static'
     Disable the build of the static framework libraries.

'--enable-optimization'
     Enable the 'optimization' mode by disabling of some useful, but
     not essential, debugging statements. Use this flag to compile a
     version of the framework libraries that are linked with EC applications
     that are fully debugged.

'--enable-full-debug'
     Enable the 'full debug' mode of the code by enabling some validation and
     logging statements. Use this flag to compile a version of the framework
     for special debugging requirements.

'--disable-fast-compilation'
     Disable the 'fast compilation' mode of the code, which proceeds by compiling
     one big file include other source files necessary to compile a library. This
     mode may need to be disabled in some specific circumtances.

'--enable-tests'
     Enable the compilation of various testing programs found under the 'tests'
     directory.


INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD THE DISTRIBUTION ON MS VISUAL C++ .NET 2003
=================================================================

Go to folder 'beagle/include/beagle' and copy file 'config.hpp.msvcpp'
as file 'config.hpp' (in the same folder). Then open the solution file
'beagle.sln' in folder 'MSVCPP'. You can compile either a debug or a release
version of the libraries. Once the libraries are compiled, you can compile
the examples provided. To do so, go to the main folder of each example and
open the appropriate solution file (.sln) in folder 'MSVCPP'.


GETTING STARTED
===============

You can experiment with the different examples provided in folder
'examples'. The README and INSTALL files of these examples explain
how to build them, The usage of the example binaries is provided by
executing them with the command-line argument '-OBusage'.
Detailed help is also provided with argument '-OBhelp'.


DOCUMENTATIONS
==============

Consult the Open BEAGLE web page (http://beagle.gel.ulaval.ca)
to get all the necessary documents to use this framework.
