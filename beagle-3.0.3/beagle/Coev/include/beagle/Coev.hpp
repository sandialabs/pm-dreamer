 *  \defgroup COEVF Co-evolution Framework
 *  \brief Specialized framework for co-evolution.
 *
 *  Co-evolution framework is based on multi-threading programming, where each thread is associated to
 *  a population. The execution sequence of each thread is the same than what usually done in the
 *  main function of standard evolutions (i.e. build system, evaluation operator, vivarium, evolver,
 *  initialize evolver, and start evolution). The population in each thread evolves independently, 
 *  with inter-thread synchronization only in co-evolutionary fitness evaluation operator. This 
 *  operator behaves quite differently than usual mono-population evaluation operator. The
 *  co-evolution evaluation procedure starts by calling Coev::EvaluationOp::makeSets, which makes
 *  evaluation sets of the evolving population and add them into shared storage structure, using
 *  method Coev::EvaluationOp::addSet. When the desired number of evaluation sets is added  (the
 *  trigger value) the co-evolutionary fitness evaluation method defined in
 *  Coev::EvaluationOp::evaluateSets is called. Pure virtual methods Coev::EvaluationOp::makeSets 
 *  and Coev::EvaluationOp::evaluateSets are problem-specific and must be defined by the user in 
 *  its co-evolutionary fitness evaluation operators.
 *
 *  A trigger value is used to specify the number of evaluation sets needed to start a
 *  co-evolutionary evaluation. This value is usually equal to the number of threads/populations used,
 *  as usually each thread/population add one evaluation set before doing the co-evolutionary
 *  evaluation operation. But different trigger value can be used depending on the context.
 *
 *  Marc Parizeau's portable C++ classes for multi-threading (defined in namespace Threading)
 *  are also provided with co-evolutionary framework. These are used internally by the co-evolution
 *  framework. Users are advised to use them for their co-evolutionary applications.
